# ESP32-S3 6 Motor Driver with IMU

**_This board is currently in development._**

This board features an **ESP32-S3** microcontroller, a **6-channel** DC **motor driver**, and an integrated **BNO086 IMU** for precise motion and orientation data.<br>
It supports **encoder feedback**, enabling accurate position control. Motors can be driven at voltages up to **36V**.

This board is perfect for robots requiring more than two motors.<br>
Simply wire your motors, connect the board to a PC, another microcontroller, or even your phone/tablet and use the ESP32-S3's versatile communication options like I2C, SPI, UART, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth to control your robot.

A full **Arduino library** for the board is available that allows you to control the motors, IMU, and read data from the encoders.<br>
Sample **ROS 2** packages are also available, that show the recommended usage of the board with ROS 2.
